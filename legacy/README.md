title: 'Introduction to JS'
---

## Purpose

This module is intended to guide you, one step at a time, through learning the frameworks and tools used daily by the JS team. Though it will not teach you *everything* you need to know, it will introduce and empower you to create a solid understanding of these frameworks and tools in hopes that you will be able to contribute to the JS team and to the applications we deal with. **You are not expected to be an expert by the end of this module**, however, you should be able to work with these frameworks and tools with a good amount of skill and comfort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description

You will be creating a generic user management system that utilizes [a backend](https://github.com/Banno/ux_onboarding) to view and edit an arbitrary list of users. More specifically, your project will allow for the creation, deletion, modification, and display of individual users profiles. As well, your project will display the entire list of users (all of which you create). The users list will be updated and modified based on the addition, modification, and deletion of individual user profiles. How your project looks and functions otherwise will be up to you.

## Resources

Most of the material needed to complete this module comes from [ngBook](https://drive.google.com/a/banno.com/uc?id=0B2ZfYb5gma2ER3gyUzhSR2FZU3M&export=download) and the [Angular API Docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api).  As you will notice, not all of the material in ngBook is used to cover the concepts needed to complete this module. Though you do not *need* to read the whole book, it is **highly encouraged that you do.** It would also be beneficial to you (and your project) to go over the sections needed to complete this module **multipule times** throughout the creation process. As well, you are not required to read through the entire AngularJS API Docs, it would be beneficial to snoop around and check out what else AngularJS has to offer.

There are many other useful resources supplementing what is covered in ngBook and the AngularJS API Docs (all of which can be found on the [resource page](../Resources). ngBook and the AngularJS API Docs may not always provide you with the knowledge you personally need to complete any given task, so utilize these resources when stuck or needing a greater understanding of a concept.

**Do not forget that members of the JS team (both interns and full-timers) are also a vast and welcoming resource you can and should utilize.**

## How to Use

The project is split into several units (x.0.0) spanning from initial project setup to project testing, all to be completed in order. Each unit is made up of sub-units (0.x.0) with a variable amount of tasks (0.0.x) with detailed steps to guide you.

**IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH GIT, GITHUB, AND VERSION CONTROL PLEASE READ [Unit 1.1.0](../1-project-setup-1#110-research) BEFORE CONTINUING**

You will create a repository through [Github] to house your project. Each unit should be started and worked on from a new branch based off the `master` branch of your project (titled something like 'unit-1'). You should begin sub-units or individual tasks with a clean working directory. Once you believe you have completed the sub-unit or task, commit the changes you have made along with a message detailing what sub-unit or task you have completed. Once committed and pushed, you will create a pull-request to be reviewed by a JS intern who has already completed the onboarding process. If there are corrections or additions to be made, the reviewer will comment on the pull-request and review the branch again once the requested changes have been made. Once the sub-unit or task has been successfully completed, the reviewer will merge the branch into your project's `master` branch. If work has been done in any new branches for proceeding units, those branches will have to be updated to reflect the changes to `master` through [rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase/) or merging the new `master` branch into the proceeding unit's branch.

It is absolutely fine to commit changes you have made when a sub-unit or task is not be complete. Though you don't need to commit every small change you make, committing often can be very beneficial.

**DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THE ONBOARDING PROCESS**

If you are focused while working for the number of hours Wes has asked you minimally put in, you should not worry about the pace at which you complete the onboarding process. Some units will take much longer than others. We expect people to work at different paces, so please do not be concerned with the amount of time it takes you to finish (unless we say something to you directly, of course).
