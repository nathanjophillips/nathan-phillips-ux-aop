# Tools For Learning

How you learn is just as important as how much time you spend learning. Your brain works in a certain way. It is, for example, fantastic at making connections between weird and different things. On the other hand, it is horrible at remembering a list of 100 letters. In a field that requires constant learning, you would be wise to consider how it works and how you might leverage it.

The following are a list of tools tested by research and practice. You aren't expected to use all or even any of them, but if you are interested in amping up your learning ability, try some of them out as you work on your project.

Many of these principles can be combined with others. For example you might work on building **Habits** that line up with your **Circadian Rhythm**. Or perhaps you'll create a **Deliberate Practice** regimen that incorporates some kind of **Spatial Reasoning** into your exercises. Or just pick one principle and focus on mastering that. Mix and match as you like, there will be some overlap anyway.

Some of the principles will be referenced in the project more than others. For example, downloadable decks of ANKI learning cards mentioned in **Spaced Repetition** will be available at the end of several of the sections.

## Principles Overview

#### [Checklists](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/checklists.md)

Your brain is great at many things, consistently following a complex list of vital details in the exact same sequence is not one of them. Using checklists ensures you get things right every time.

#### [Chunking](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/chunking.md)

Because at some point your brain took the information of each letter and chunked it into a series of patterns that you now easily recognize after years of reading practice. Every task you take for granted--typing, reading, speaking English--is a group of small tasks working together to do more complex tasks.

An effective learning approach is to break a task into its smallest chunks and master the small tasks one at a time. Once you've learbed those smaller tasks, you can group them together into patterns to tackle more complex problems.

#### [Circadian Rhythms](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/circadian-rhythms.md)

Your brain follows a daily pattern that affects your energy, mood, concentration, and creativity depending on the time of day. Whenever possible, do the right work at the right time.

#### [Deliberate Practice](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/deliberate-practice.md)

You've likely heard of the 10,000 hour rule: _10,000 hours of practice will get you to skill mastery_. Well, sort of. Essential to the process is the idea of **deliberate practice**, which has three important pieces:

1. Specific goals for improvement
2. Working constantly at the edge of your competence
3. Getting continuous feedback

#### [Habits](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/habits.md)

For better or worse, roughly half of your activities during the day are automatic. Thankfully these habits can be effectively trained using the pattern of **cue** --> **routine** --> **reward.**

#### [Spaced Repetition Learning](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/spaced-repetition.md)

When you learn something new, you immediately begin forgetting it. The way to bring this information up to snuff is to review it. The trick is, reviewing information _just before_ forgetting it is actually the best way to push it deeper into your memory. Some studies have found that medical students and doctors who used spaced repetition were up to 40% more efficient with their learning. But that's a lot of remembering what to remember, which is why programs like Anki or Brainscape exist to automate the process for you.

#### Spatial Reasoning and Memory(https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/learning-practices/spatial-reasoning-and-memory.md)

Your brain's ability to remember and interact with visual space is superior to trying to remember a list. The people who participate in memorization competitions are everyday people who among other things have developed spatial memory techniques in order to do things like memorize the order of the cards in multiple shuffled decks. Learn how to use imagery and metaphor to handle memorization and interaction with complex ideas.
