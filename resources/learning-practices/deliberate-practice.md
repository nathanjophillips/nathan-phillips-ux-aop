# Deliberate Practice

Improving a skill is not just a matter of how much you practice. You can play the same chord on a guitar over and over without becoming a virtuoso. **Deliberate practice** is an approach to practice that keeps you moving foward by identifying a weakness and strategically dealing with it.

## What Deliberate Practice Looks Like

### Specific Design

Deliberate practice is designed to improve a specific task.

Coding to be better at coding will yeild some results, but targeted practice, perhaps around improving your vocabulary of methods, or perhaps your typing speed will get you better faster.

### No Pain, Very Little Gain

At this point it might seem like every day brings a unique challenge to your skills. Some of these challenges are painful. You should be grateful, this is the first piece to deliberate practice.

If you are not experiencing pain, then you are not pushing on the edges of your skillset and your improvement will be stunted.

This is not to say that every moment of your programming should be painful. Most of your work will be applying your current skillset to do our work. But this isn't the same as improving our skills as a programmer.

### Not Fun

Keeping with the fact that deliberate practice is cognitively painful, it's not always going to seem like fun to push on the edges of your understanding. Not that you cannot find a way to have fun and improve, but that fun will have to be something you find a way to incorporate as it will not be a natural part of the process for most people.

### Continous Feedback

The more feedback you can get, the better. This could be from a peer, a coach, a supervisor, anyone who has more competence in the specific area you'd like to improve. Outside perspective can help you see things you weren't even looking for. If you are working on improving your programming vocabulary, someone looking at your code might notice a situation where there is a method that takes care of five lines of code for you.

The great part is that this already happens at a certain level at Banno by virtue of code reviews. But asking a specific person specifically skilled in this area to give you ongoing feedback will make this part of the process far more effective.

## For The Project

- [ ] ID an area or areas you'd like to improve over the course of the project.
- [ ] Write specifically how you will go about improving the ID'd skill.
- [ ] Ask someone to give you ongoing feedback regarding that skill(s).
- [ ] Do the work. Embrace the pain as signs of improvement.

### Specific Design: ID Area For Improvement And Make A Plan

There are a lot of ways you could get better at programming. Maybe you want to hone your design skills or understand build tools. If you are trying to improve your typing speed you might recognize that you aren't very good at getting to the "=" with your pinky very quickly, or that "( )" slows you down. Pick one area and design a system of practice for it.

Write down what you are going to practice, how you are going to do it, and how much time you are going to dedicate to it before moving on to something else.

### Ask For Ongoing Feedback

Find someone with a certain skillset and ask them to review your code with that skillset specifically in mind. Make changes and have them review it again. Get their input on how they acieved that skillset and what you should be doing now to get to where they are.

If they are willing, have them keep reviewing code on an ongoing basis, again with a focus on the skillset you are trying to improve. That may be for a few weeks or a few months depending on what you are trying to learn and what they are willing to do. Having one person who tracks with you over several weeks will help them to identify your bad habits better than several people who review your code once.

Also it _should_ be obvious, but be ready for critical feedback. It can be painful, even if delivered thoughtfully. Brace yourself, take it in, and let it help you get better.

### Lean Into the Pain

Pain is a sign that you are challenging yourself. Learn to get excited about it. When working on a certain thing is no longer painful, it means that you are no longer pushing out the edges of your skillset. If the goal is improvement, it's time to move on to a new challenge.
