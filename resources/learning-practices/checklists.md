# Checklists

## Principle

Your brain is not that great at remembering a long list of details, nor is it great at storing information by what is actually important or not. Toss some emotional pressure or fatigue into the mix and things can get jumbled quickly. Checklists remove our mediocre memory and emotional fluctuations from the equation, or at least lessen their impact on your process.

## Experts And Airplanes

During WWII Boeing had problems getting their now infamous B-17 bomber off the ground. Experienced pilots were crashing the plane at alarming rates. What Boeing realized was that the process of just getting a Boeing into the air was a list too many different important steps in a specific order for any human to handle. So they instituted the first flight checklist, a process that is standard practice today. The checklists solved the problem and the number of human error incidents in takeoff and landing nearly disappeared.

## Safe Babies

In delivery rooms, Virginia Apgar realized that there was no standard for analyzing the health of a newborn. Various doctors used various factors: color of the baby, does the baby cry, etc. But largely they were operating off their intuition immediately after an emotional event.

So she developed the Apgar test:

Appearance (skin color)
Pulse (heart rate)
Grimace response (reflexes)
Activity (muscle tone)
Respiration (breathing rate and effort)

The test is given at one minute and five minutes. Each category recieves a quick score of 0, 1, or 2. Any baby who scores over 7 is considered healthy.

Another cavaet of the test is that it has to be administered by someone who was not a part of the delivery process. Apgar knew that their emotions would bias the outcome of the test.

It is estimated that the Apgar test saved 20,000 lives in its first decade.

## Brain Dump / Todos

According to Daniel Levitin in his book The Organized Mind, your brain runs items around in your brain in a way that can be tracked with brain scans, even if you aren't concious that its happening. Think of it as a bit like a computer running twenty small programs in the background. You aren't using them directly, and each one is a small program, but together they sap your computing power.

Dumping any todos onto a list (which is really just a one time checklist) that you know you will get to later is like shutting down these programs. It clears up brain space.

## For the Project

### PRs And Issues

There are things you should absolutely be checking for every single time you put up a PR. The earlier a team catches bugs, the less costly that bug is.

After you dig into your project a bit, you'll implement a gitHub template for PRs. These templates are a lifesaver. They reduce the number of bugs that are going to get through your code. Each item on that list was thoughtfully put there so don't ignore them.

If you identify a particular item that you tend to miss in your PRs, add an item to your issues or PRs template checklist that will offset the chances of you missing that item in the future.

- [ ] _Tell people who need to know that the PR is opened_
- [ ] _Double check that I titled the PR correctly_
- [ ] _Double check that I pulled in any changes from the master branch_

Checklists are a great way to preserve learning and improve your process.

### Day Start / Day End Checklist

As an employee at Banno, there are daily or weekly items that just have to be taken care of in order to be a part of a working team. Email, meetings, trainings, etc. To help with these, create a quick day start and day end checklist that you make a habit of completing during the first or last 10 minutes of your day.

**DAY START**

- [ ] Clock In
- [ ] Check the Calendar For The Day
- [ ] Review Yesterday's Work
- [ ] Identify Today's Work
- [ ] Write Standup

**DAY END**

- [ ] Check Tomorrow's Calendar
- [ ] List The Work You Did Today
- [ ] Bookmark Where You Left Off
- [ ] Check Email
- [ ] Clock Out

It seems like a silly list, but these are things I want to make sure to do daily, knowing that a) I tend to miss important details and b) every human misses details. It's just a simple and effective way to offset that and be a better co worker.

### Keep A Brain Dump Paper Handy

Keep out a piece of scratch paper and keep a running checklist of items that come to mind. These things could be personal items, for work, whatever. You might even add an item whenever you come across something that you are curious to explore more later.

- [ ] _Research what an iterator is._

If you are coming to the end of the day, brain dump every possible thing you can think of onto a todo list that you can look over the next day.

Never assume you will remember anything. Even if your list gets a little sloppy, its not that difficult to go through items one by one to see if they still need to be completed and rewrite them on a fresh piece of paper.

While most phones and computers have todo list programs, the pen and the paper is right there. The paper won't have popups to distract you, and you are more likely to see and consult the list later if it is in your physical space.

### Leaving Things Undone

Sometimes the list seems overwhelming. Sometimes some things just don't get done.

Listing things out is not necessarily about doing everything. Rather, the process helps you be more intentional about what you really want and need to do. For example, if you are landing a B-17 bomber and the checklist says:

- [ ] _shut off engine 4_,

But what if a Nazi blew up that engine? Check it off the list and move on.

There will be cases where your checklist items are not applicable, but you at least intentionally decided to not do it, which is better than accidentally forgetting something important.

Checklists don't need to control your actions. But as you refine your checklists, you should probably have a compelling reason to ignore an item.
