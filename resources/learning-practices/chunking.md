## The Principle

Most 'basic' tasks are the combination of a pile of skills you are so skilled at that you don't even think about them.

Wch is wy it isnt dffclt, but knd of werd tht yu cn rd ths.

Think about what goes into reading:

- recognizing symbols
- memorized phonetic sounds tied to those symbols
- phonetic rules for vowel sounds
- context of the word being used
- intuitive understanding of verbs, nouns, adverbs

Your brain has condensed all this into patterns so that you can read more quickly. It has chunked all those smaller skills into a larger single skill. So tht it dsnt evn nd to see all th ltters anymre.

This process of combining smaller skills into larger ones is called **chunking**

## Applied to Coding

```js
otherArray = [];

array.forEach(item => {
  if (item.name === document.getElementById("input").value) {
    otherArray.push(`${item.name} + the ${item.job} at ${item.business}`);
  }
});
```

This function includes the following 'skills'

- objects
- accessing object properties
- arrow functions
- higher order functions
- .forEach()
- .getElementById() (idea)
- .getElementById() (syntax)
- html elements
- .value property
- equality operators
- if statements
- template literals (idea)
- template literals (syntax)

You could probably break each of those down even further. Some of these things you know and recognize, others you don't. Instead of trying to figure out the whole thing at once, master `if` statements, then learn about higher order functions and accessing the value of an element using the .value property. **If you create a checklist of items you don't understand and start hacking away at them, they will slowly but surely start to make sense.**

If you spend a lot of time working with for loops and if statements, your brain will eventually chunk those pieces together into a single if-for skill.

## For Your Project

When you encounter any kind of complexity that you don't recognize, don't freak out. Give yourself permission to settle into learning all the little skills necessary that will eventually be combined into one big skill. In the long run, you will save yourself a lot of time and pain.

Break the code into its smallest parts and identify the pieces you don't know. Pick one and start learning (you'll probably have to break that into even smaller pieces to learn about). Depending on how much you already know, it might look something like this:

- Learn about `for` loops
- Learn about `.push()`
- Write `for` loops that use `push`
- Learn about `template literals`
- Write `for` loops that `push` `template literals`
- Wash, Rinse, Repeat

You get the idea. Add to what you already know one bite sized chunk at a time.

Once you've mastered a few items on your "I don't know" list, look over the code again to see if it makes more sense. Make a new list about what doesn't make sense now,and head back to doing some more chunking.

This will seem laborious at first, but over time you will go frm slgging thrugh indvdl lttrs to skimmng ovr the tp of pttrns.
