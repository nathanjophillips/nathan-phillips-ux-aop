## Principle

Strategically build good habits using the process of **cue**, **routine**, **reward**.

## Who Is Really In Charge Here

Its tempting to think that you just need more discipline or will power. The problem is that much of what you do is unconcious and automatic.

- You are driving to a familiar place, and suddenly realize you don't remember anything that happened since you pulled out of your driveway.
- You open the fridge five times in 10 minutes without actually eating anything.
- Your alarm goes off and you trudge ape-man style toward the bathroom approximately 15 minutes before you are actually awake.

The bad news is, the brain doesn't distinguish between good and bad habits. The good news is, habits can be formed so that you automatically do the sorts of things that make you a healthier human and for our concerns, a better programmer. It just takes identifying and tweaking a process of **cue**, **routine**, **reward**.

Instead of trying to will-power your way out of bad habits, strategically shape them. [Charles Duhigg breaks it down with a great cookie example from his own life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1eYrhGeffc)

## Cue, Routine, Reward

### Cue

_I walk by the fridge._

It can be any sort of pattern such as time of day, seeing a certain person, going to a location, a sound, a smell, even a color.

### Routine

_I open the door and start looking around._

Routine is the pattern of behavior triggered by the cue. So my routine is to reach out my arm, grab the handle, open the door, and start searching for something to eat. This routine gets carried out even if I am not remotely hungry, or we're going to eat dinner in 5 minutes.

### Reward

_Oooo twinkies._

My brain knows that if it opens the door, it will get a hit of processed sugar or some other treat. And so without notifying my concious mind, it goes for that sweet sweet yellow cakey goodness.

## Ripple Effects of Keystone Habits

Keystone habits are when you identify a single habit to relentlessly form. These habits seem mundane at first, but have a ripple effect for individuals and organizations.

When Paul O'niel took over as CEO the failing aluminum company Alcoa, he focused obsessively on safety as their company had a high rate of on the job injury at the time.

- For the sake of safety, they upgraded faulty machinery, which made their processes more efficienty and saved them money.

- They implemented an early internal email system for managers to check in on safety issues, which also ended up being used to communicate about global aluminum prices in real time (an assumed thing now). They were able to get ahead of the market because of this.

- They realized that workers were telling managers about safety problems, but those reports were not getting communicated up the line. So they provided a way to ensure employee feedback went up the management chain. On the ground employees often had great innovations or saw potential future problems that managers were not seeing. Upper management was now looking over these ideas and so again systems improved.

Ultimately the focus on building a habit of safety also turned Alcoa into healthy company and a leader in the market. Identifying a single keystone habit will compound into other positive benefits that you never intended.

## For the Project

### Standups

There is already a keystone habit among the intern team, it's daily standups. The habit is just to show up and say what you are doing. But that habit also makes you plan ahead for your day, set goals, communicate with others on the team, etc. It's a simple thing, but carries larger implications. Don't skimp on it.

### Identify Your Keystone Habit

Take a bit to think about one small habit that would significantly alter your life. Maybe that's getting into the gym. If you made it to the gym for an hour on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, you'd have more energy, clearer thinking, sleep better,better health, you'd do better work, you'd be happier (which would probably make you a better friend/spouse/co-worker). If this were a habit over the course of your life, it would likely also save you thousands in medical expenses, tack more and healthier years on to your life, and probably gave a significant positive affect your career (since people often prefer to work with healthy, clear headed, happy people).

Also, decide clearly what the action is. Make it frequent enough that you can actually form a habit. But also make it easy enough that you will actually do it. As a programmer, maybe you want to up your game consistently. Have a set 10 minutes just before dinner that you watch videos in a course on a new programming topic. Five days a week is 3 hours and 20 minutes of new learning a month, that's a whole work week each year dedicated to new learning.

### Set Up A Cue

Once you've identified your habit, set up a **cue.** Maybe that's an alarm at the same time on your phone every Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Or it could be that you already have a habit of going to the grocery store on Mondays, make that your cue to go to the gym first and then to the store.

### The Routine

### Reward Yourself

Finally, make sure to reward yourself after completing the habit. Do not skip on this. _EVERY_ time you complete the task, reward yourself. This will help you get to the gym and stay there for ten minutes.

The great part about healthy habits is that they often carry their own rewards, though it is usually delayed gratification. Working out is painful, but finishing a workout often feels great. Eventually your brain will learn to love that after workout feeling and you won't need to bribe yourself anymore.

### Bad Habits

Undoing a bad habit takes a little deeper investigation. The cue and the reward for the routine might not be immediately apparent.

Let say in the middle of a coding session your hand magically opens up the browser and types in your favorite My Little Pony reddit channel before you even realize what's happening. What was happening when you did this? Was there a new problem that was hard to solve? Did someone just message you some unfair criticism? Did you just realize that the last three hours of code you wrote is now useless?

As Duhigg mentioned in the above video, he ate a cookie at 3:30 every day. The time of day was his cue. Are you going to reddit because that magical pony fan thread desparately needs you? Or is it because you are running into a hard learning curve and imposter syndrome is rearing its ugly head? These routines don't appear out of nowhere. They have cues. Hunt down the cue.

When you identify the cue, try to figure out what reward you are trying to get. As it turned out, Charles Duhigg didn't want the cookie so much as he wanted to socialize with people. Once he went directly to the reward of talking to people near him at 3:30 instead of to the vending machine, his desire for cookies went away. Notice the trick here. He didn't try to get rid of the cue that lead him to eating cookies, he hijacked it into something else and consequently lost 12 pounds fairly quickly.

In the face of imposter syndrome, maybe what you really want is a place where you feel competent. That's the reward. Feeling competent. So try reaching out to a co-worker or supervisor and ask for help in an area you are stuck on. Let them know if you are feeling particularly stupid at the moment. They can likely resonate with the feeling. So instead of getting the feeling of competence, you are rewarded with the reminder that the feeling of incompetence in this field is not abnormal. As you alter your response to the routine, you will get the reward of human connection as we all go through very similar things.

You won't entirely eliminate bad habits, but you can instead replace them with better responses to your cues.
