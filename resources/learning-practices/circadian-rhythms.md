## The Principle

Your brain follows a daily pattern called the Circadian Rhythm. It shapes when and how you sleep and what your energy levels are at various points in the day.

You can't change it much, so you might as well figure out your rhythm and ride it well.

### Morning People / Evening People: Your Rhythm

- 75% of people **peak** in the morning, followed by an afternoon **slump**, then a late afternoon **recovery**.
- 25% follow an inverted pattern of morning recovery, afternoon slump, evening peak.

Your pattern can be tweaked slightly by diet, quality of rest, time of year, etc. And more precise times for **peak**, **slump**, **recovery**, vary from person to person. But your particular order and the times they come is largely fixed.

#### Peak

- During `peak` hours your brain is in the best condition to do mathmatical linear thinking.

#### Slump

- Shallow work like email is best suited for the `slump` if nap time isn't an option. Unless it is a very important email that has to be right.

- IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, AVOID MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS OR WORKING ON IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS DURING THE `SLUMP`. FAILURE TO DO THIS WILL COST YOU IN THE LONG RUN.

#### Recovery

- `Recovery` time is perfect for creative insight work.

#### Real World Instances

In one set of studies, companies that had their investor call in the morning consistently experienced a price bump independent of other factors. Calls in the mid afternoon consistently experienced a stock price dip.

The emotional swing of Twitter follows this pattern globally. Twitter is generally more 'happy' in the morning, depressed in the afternoon, and recovers a bit of pleasantry in the late afternoon/evening.

In another study, judges were found to reject parole for minorities at a higher rates than whites during the afternoon, which lines up with most people's `slump`. This spike dropped some if the sentencing took place after a judge had a small break.

## For The Project

### Avoid The Slump

It may seem more productive to push through the slump and keep working on reallyComplexSpaghetti(), but during the slump you are wide open to simple mistakes that could end up costing you significantly more later.

If you absolutely have to work on something complex through the slump, even a 10-15 minute nap before doing that work will offset how severe the slump is.

Save yourself a lot of pain and time and figure out when your slump is and put all your shallow tasks during that time. If you are going to grab coffee with someone, schedule it for your slump. If you have some not very important but still necessary emails to send out, save them for the slump.

BEWARE OF THE SLUMP!

### Think Ahead And Sort Your Work

When you start your day, think through the various things you need to accomplish and divide them into three categories:

- Complex Detail Work / Linear Thinking
- Shallow Work
- Insight/Creative Work

Here's what mine might look like:

- Complex:

1.  Break reallyComplexSpaghetti() function into five different functions.
2.  Work on making requested changes to PR.

- Shallow:

1.  Send email about fixing timesheet
2.  Set a time to meet with intern (we're going to need a creative solution so schedule it for recovery time).

- Insight/Creative:

1.  Grab a pen and paper and think through the flow of information in the app. See if you can find a simpler way of organizing it.
2.  Try out a few versions of solutions. If possible, don't submit the changes until you've had a chance to review the code again during peak hours. You'll be better at catching detail mistakes during that time.

Once you've made your list for the day, try to work on items during the time of day that your brain function best suits it.

So If I've had problems with my reallyComplexSpaghetti() function till lunch, I might set it aside until about 3:30 (When I start to experience `recovery`) then see if I can find a new creative solution. Finally, I'd wait until the next morning to review my code for detailed errors before submitting it for a PR review.

### It Won't Be Perfect

The principle here is to put things at the correct time _when possible_. Life doesn't always work out so neatly for us, but when you have a choice of when you are doing your task, doing the thing at the right time will mean better work that is more enjoyable for you.
