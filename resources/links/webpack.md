# Resources for Learning Webpack

## Getting Started
#### [Official Webpack Docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)

#### [Webpack Repository](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

#### [Webpack: The Basics -- Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/webpack-the-basics-2712a7ad640b)
A nice small-scale tutorial that can be done in 20 minutes or so to get on the absolute ground floor of Webpack.

#### [Beginner's Guide to Webpack - JavaScript Training](https://medium.com/javascript-training/beginner-s-guide-to-webpack-b1f1a3638460)

## Polymer and Webpack
#### [How to use Polymer with Webpack](http://robdodson.me/how-to-use-polymer-with-webpack/)

#### [Polymer + Webpack: Bringing Web Components to a Framework Near You (Polymer Summit 2017)](https://youtu.be/LpMI_Do5t5U)
Most comprehensive video describing how Webpack works with `polymer-webpack-loader` to load Polymer 2 elements into Webpack (much like the context of this project)

#### [Polymer 3.0 Preview - Building a mini card game](https://medium.com/@jecelynyeen/polymer-3-0-preview-building-a-mini-card-game-ce8948265fd6)
This article can be useful for understanding the differences between Polymer 2 and Polymer 3 as well as functionality of Webpack, but it can be confusing since it involves TypeScript and Polymer 3, which this project does not. Best for understanding how Webpack operates with other technology.

#### [Polymer Skeleton: Base project setup using Polymer 3, Webpack, PostCSS and service workers](https://github.com/PolymerX/polymer-skeleton)
Not usable on the project (we use the Banno-scoped version of Polymer 2), but useful for side projects or just to explore Polymer 3 and Webpack.
