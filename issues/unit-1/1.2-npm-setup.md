# 1.2: npm and Yarn
## Main Goals
1. Install Node and npm
2. Install Yarn
3. Start managing dependencies in the project with a `package.json` file
4. Use a `.gitignore` to prevent dependency code (`node_modules`) from being managed by Git
### When Accomplished
- [ ] Node and npm are installed
- [ ] Yarn is installed
- [ ] You have a `package.json` file located at the root of the project
  - [ ] `package.json` contains the `name` property
  - [ ] `package.json` contains the `version` property
- Your project
  - [ ] now contains a `node_modules` directory
  - [ ] now contains a `.gitignore` file which excludes the `node_modules` directory
## Research
1. npm docs:
    - [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)
    - [Installing Node.js and updating npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
    - [Installing npm packages locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally)
    - [Semantic Versioning and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning)
2. [git docs: `.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
3. [Dev Dependencies vs. Dependencies](https://medium.com/@dylanavery720/npmmmm-1-dev-dependencies-dependencies-8931c2583b0c)
## Notes
- When you install Node, npm is installed as well.
- npm and Yarn both do the same thing. Yarn has some features that make it more reliable to use across an organization and it's what the UX team uses on their work.
- Eventually you may run into a situation where your Node version is too new to run certain packages. [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) manages multiple installs of different versions of Node.
