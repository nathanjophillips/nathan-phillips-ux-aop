## Notes
1. Github account
    - It does not matter whether you authenticate via a TOTP mobile app or text message
    - Name your repository something along the lines of `firstName-lastName-ux-iop`
2. Git repository
    - When creating a local version of your repository, you'll want to **clone** using **SSH**
    - The command line is _probably_ most reliable way to work with git, however, it isn't the most intuitive interface for everyone. [Atlassian's SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) provides a visual component to git the command line lacks, which you are free to utilize.
    - If you have not found a text editor that you like, many members of the JS team use [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
