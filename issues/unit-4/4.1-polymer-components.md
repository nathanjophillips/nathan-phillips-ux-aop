# 4.1: Polymer Components
## Main Goals
- Separate patterns from the project into different components
- Include those components in your Polymer app
### When Accomplished
- The following HTML pages are represented in the Polymer app:
    - [ ] user-list.html
    - [ ] user-profile.html
    - [ ] create-user.html
    - [ ] edit-user.html
- [ ] The `user-list` element has `user-profile` components nested inside it
- [ ] The `user-profile` component maintains its expand and collapse functionality

## Notes
- It's perfectly fine to put all of the components on the same page--you'll be improving UX later on in the project. If you want to separate your components out into separate pages, you can look into the Banno-scoped `web-component-router`, which is what the UX team uses to route pages in their Polymer apps (just search `web-component-router` on the [Banno npm registry](https://npm.banno-internal.com/)).
- There still isn't a data system to work a dataset into the project (that's up next!) but don't let that stop you from learning some data concepts. You're free to hard code the same user a few times in the user list, but if you want to pass data from the parent (as in `<user-profile first-name="John" last-name="Doe">`), you can [take a look at how data binding works](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/data-binding).
