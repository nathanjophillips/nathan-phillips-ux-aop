# 4.2: `localStorage` API
## Main Goal
Create a data structure using `localStorage` to hold user data for the app to use
### When Accomplished
- [ ] The localStorage API module meets the requirements described in the [localStorage API specification](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/specs/localStorage-api-spec.md), including the following functions:
  - [ ] `createUser`
  - [ ] `getUser`
  - [ ] `getUsers`
  - [ ] `updateUser`
  - [ ] `deleteUser`
  - [ ] `generateId`
  - [ ] `validateUser`
  - [ ] any optional functions or helpers
- [ ] All API code is located in `src/api/`

## Notes
- `localStorage` is not cleared automatically. You have to go into preferences and clear site data in order to clear localStorage.
- There are many libraries that can help you build a database-like structure in `localStorage`--it might help to look for resources like this if you're stuck.
