# Mini Project: Pagination/Show More Button
## Main Goal
Add scalability to your app by limiting the number of users that load at one time.
### When Accomplished
- [ ] Only a certain number X users load on page load
- [ ] There is a control that triggers the app to load the next batch of X users
- [ ] **(Optional)** There is a control that shows all users at once
## Notes
- This requires a larger data set of users. This mini project would pair well with the [Database](./add-database.md) mini project.
