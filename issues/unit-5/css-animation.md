## Notes
- You can test your app on a mobile device! It may not be accessible if you're on VPN, but if you're _off_ VPN, you can run `webpack` to bundle the app, then `serve dist` (if you have the `serve` package installed globally)--it will run an HTTP server and print out the IP address where your project will be available on the local network.
- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all have a responsive design mode with presets for all kinds of phone screens that are also great for testing various screen widths.
