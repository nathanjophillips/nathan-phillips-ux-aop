# Mini Project: Add a Database
## Main Goal
Refactor your app to get its data from a live database using asynchronous requests.
### When Accomplished
- [ ] The user data in the app now comes from a live online database
- [ ] The app's client-side interface continues to represent user data as defined in the [`localStorage` API spec](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/specs/localStorage-api-spec.md)
## Research
1. [Fetching Data from the Server - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data)
2. [Synchronous and asynchronous requests - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests)
## Resources
- [Postman - API development tool](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- [Promise - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
## Notes
- The frontend functionality should not be noticeably different in any way. All the changes should be to the interface the app uses to access user data.
