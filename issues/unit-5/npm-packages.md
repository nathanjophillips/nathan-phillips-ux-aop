# Mini Project: NPM Packages
## Main Goal
Optimize your app with packages from npm.
### When Accomplished
- [ ] Your project has at least one useful npm package added to `package.json`
- [ ] That package is imported in project code using Webpack's `import` syntax
- [ ] The package is used in your project to improve user experience in a meaningful way (page speed, data processing, etc)

## Notes
- If you use a big library to do just one or two things, you may want to explore [Webpack's tree shaking feature](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), which will improve performance by only bundling the library code your app ends up using.
