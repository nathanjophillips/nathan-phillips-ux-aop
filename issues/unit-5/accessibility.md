# Mini Project: Accessibility
## Main Goal
Maximize accessibility by using ARIA attributes, 
### When Acccomplished
- [ ] Any elements using visiblity toggles properly implement the `aria-hidden` attribute 
- [ ] Any navigation elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] HTML `<label>` elements are implemented on any form inputs
## Research
1. [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
2. [HTML Forms Tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/forms/)
## Resources
- [WCAG 2.0 Quick Reference (Official W3C accessibility guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0)
- [WCAG Contrast Checker for testing background colors on text](https://contrastchecker.com/)
- [HTML Forms - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms)
## Notes
- Chrome's DevTools have an `Audits` tab (featured in the [Lighthouse mini project](./lighthouse-test.md)) that run an accessibility audit to test for accessibility. It will be beneficial to test your app for accessibility manually as well.
- Mobile support is part of accessibility--it is helpful for users to have a usable interface on small screens as well as zoomed in as far as 200% on large screens.
