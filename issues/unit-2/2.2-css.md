## Notes
- You can experiment with newer technologies like [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox), or [animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations), but nothing too intense is required.  The purpose here is to demonstrate a basic understanding of CSS.
