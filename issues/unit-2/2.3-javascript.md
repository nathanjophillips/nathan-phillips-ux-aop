# 2.3: Basic JavaScript: Minimizing/Expanding Functionality
With Webpack and Polymer set up, we're going to go back to your HTML files for a bit and add some basic JavaScript.
## Main Goal
Add expanding and minimizing functionality to the user profile
### When Accomplished
- [ ] Clicking a button will expand the user profile
  - [ ] The button is styled in a way that says "hey, I'll expand the profile if you click me"
- [ ] Clicking a button will minimize the user profile 
  - [ ] The button is styled in a way that says "hey, le'me make this profile a little smaller"
## Side Goal
Have expanding and minimizing functionality run by the same button
### When Accomplished
- [ ] If minimized, clicking the button will expand the user profile
- [ ] If expanded, clicking the button will minimize the user profile
