# 2.1: Creating HTML Pages

## Main Goals
1. Create static HTML pages to display user information
2. Create accessible forms to input user information
3. Create and implmement a persistent navigation pattern

### When Accomplished
1. The User Profile HTML page
    - [ ] has one user profile displaying information following the [user data model](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/specs/localStorage-api-spec.md#the-user-model)
2. The User List HTML page
    - [ ] shows several condensed user profiles in contrast to the complete profile on the User Profile page
3. The Create User HTML page
    - [ ] contains a form to create a new user with a field for each public property in the [user data model](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/specs/localStorage-api-spec.md#the-user-model)
    - [ ] form uses [accessibility markup](http://www.washington.edu/accessibility/checklist/forms/) such as `id` attributes and `<label>` tags to give the form basic accessibility
      - Both the form and submit button do not need to be operational
4. The Edit User HTML page
    - [ ] contains a form to edit an existing user
        - Should be identical to the Create User form
    - [ ] form uses [accessibility markup](http://www.washington.edu/accessibility/checklist/forms/) such as `id` attributes and `<label>` tags to give the form basic accessibility
        - Both the form and submit button do not need to be operational
5. All HTML pages
  - [ ] have an identical and functioning navigation

## Notes
1. For now, the user profile and user list pages should be populated with dummy data. Eventually this data will be retrieved from `localStorage`.
2. All pages will eventually be tied to the same data, so dummy data should follow [the user data model](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/specs/localStorage-api-spec.md#the-user-model).
