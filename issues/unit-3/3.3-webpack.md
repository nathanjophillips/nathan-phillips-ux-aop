## 3.3: Webpack
## Main Goals
1. Configure Webpack with Polymer to build out an app.
2. Organize project so that all source code is separate from project metadata and build code.
3. Refactor npm scripts to use Webpack.
### When Accomplished
- You've added new dev dependencies:
  - [ ] `webpack`
  - [ ] `webpack-cli`
  - [ ] `webpack-dev-server`
  - [ ] `babel-core`
  - [ ] `babel-loader`
  - [ ] `polymer-webpack-loader`
  - [ ] `file-loader`
  - [ ] `css-loader`
  - [ ] `html-webpack-plugin`
  - [ ] `copy-webpack-plugin`
- You've added the Banno-scoped Polymer and design components as normal dependencies:
  - [ ] `@banno/polymer`
  - [ ] `@banno/jha-design-components`
- [ ] `webpack.config.js` file exists in the root of the project
- [ ] You've added the `jha-design-components-loader` tool in the `tools` directory
- [ ] `webpack` command returns no errors
- [ ] The `start` script now runs `webpack-dev-server`
- [ ] A new script has been added to `package.json` called `build` which simply runs `webpack`
- [ ] You've copied over all content from the `webpack-boilerplate` directory in the project resources to your project's `src` directory
- [ ] The new file structure of your project matches the file structure outlined [here](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/blob/master/resources/specs/unit-3.3-project-structure.md).

## Notes
- Webpack can be installed globally, but it's better to install on a per-project basis.
- `webpack.config.js` is already written so it just needs to be placed in the root of the project.
  - The configuration we use requires a few other files to be added. Make sure to copy over everything from the `webpack-boilerplate` directory--our specific configuration relies on an 'entry' JavaScript file and a 'template' HTML file as well as the Polymer components that will start out the Polymer implementation of your project.
## Resources
- [Webpack boilerplate for this project](https://github.com/Banno/ux-intern-onboarding/tree/master/resources/webpack-boilerplate)
  - Make sure to read through `webpack.config.js`--there are plenty of comments that will help inform your understanding of what Webpack does with your files.
